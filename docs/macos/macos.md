# MacOS


## Collection of nice tools on MacOS

- [Open Source Mac Apps](https://indiegoodies.com/awesome-open-source-mac-apps)

## Window management

- divvy
- rectangle

Divvy is the one I have been using for years. It's good enough, not sure if it's worth to try something different. Heard some good words about `rectangle`, and also [swish](https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/), which is a paid software.

## Cleanup tools

- CLI: [mac-cleanup-py](https://github.com/mac-cleanup/mac-cleanup-py)

brew tap mac-cleanup/mac-cleanup-py
brew install mac-cleanup-py
mac-cleanup
```
